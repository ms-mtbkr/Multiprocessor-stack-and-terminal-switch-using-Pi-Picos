Bugs/Fixes

  Install MMBasic V5.07.03 on "home". This is important! 7.06 with all of it's "goodies" won't work :-|

  Terminal nodes ("larry", "moe", "curly") can be MMBasic V5.07.06. For that matter, Micropython also
  runs. Of course, if you cut the wires, you can connect anything that does TTL serial :-)
